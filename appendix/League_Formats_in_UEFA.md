The table below presents formats that are in operation in the UEFA
countries in the 2017/2018 (or 2018) season. For brevity, $kRR_{n}$ denotes
a $k$ round-robin tournament with $n$ teams involved.
The "$+$" symbol denotes that a given entity employs a two-stage format and "$/$"  denotes round-robin tournaments played simultaneously.
If after the first stage the ranking table is not split equally, superscripts $i, j$ in $kRR_{n}^{i-j}$
denotes that teams ranked from $i$ to $j$ compete in separate $k$ round-robin tournaments with
$n = j - i + 1$ teams. Note that if this is the case, the number of rounds played by the teams may differ.
Finally, prefix "$\frac{1}{2}$" denotes that the points after the first stage are divided by two and rounded when necessary.

For example, the Cypriot league format is denoted with $2RR_{14}$ $+$ $(2RR_{6}^{1-6} / 2RR_{6}^{7-12})$.
It means that in the first stage there are 14 teams competing in a double round-robin tournament. Next, the league table is split into two parts:
the first consist of the teams ranked from 1 to 6 and the second one from 7 to 12 (the last two teams are directly relegated).
In both subgroups, another $2RR$ tournament is played (with six teams each). Hence, there are 36 rounds and $2 \cdot {14 \choose 2} + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot {6 \choose 2} = 242$
matches are played in total.

There are two countries missing in the comparison. In Liechtenstein, no domestic championship is played
(some teams compete in Switzerland), only domestic cup is played. In San Marino, there are 15 teams
and league starts with two groups (7 and 8 teams each) in which $3RR$ is played. Following that, a double
elimination tournament is played to determine the champion.

Perhaps the most complicated league format is employed in Belgium. After the first stage
the teams ranked 1--6 compete in the championship group. The teams ranked 7--15 are coupled
with teams from the second division to compete for one extra spot in international cups.
The lowest ranked team is directly relegated. In Bulgaria and Denmark, with some modifications,
the league table is also split into three groups after the first stage of the competition.

In certain countries (including Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Iceland and the Netherlands) after a regular season,
an extra round of play (typically a single elimination tournament)
is employed in order to determine the league champion or the teams participating in the international cups competition in the season to follow.
