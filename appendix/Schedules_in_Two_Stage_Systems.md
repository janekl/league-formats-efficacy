The two tables below give example schedules of the final round in the $2RR + (1RR/1RR)$ league format
employed in the championship and the relegation group in the case of 12 and 16 teams.
The integer codes represent a team's rank after the first stage of the tournament.
The schedule given in the second table was originally applied in the Polish league in the 2013/14 season.
The schedule given in the first table is its modification for 12 teams.
Notably, according to these schedules, the top half teams after the initial stage of the
competition play one more match at their home field than the bottom half. Moreover, the match
between the first and the second team after the first phase is played at the first team's home field.
